                <h3>Client-side engineering:</h3>
                <p>Client-side engineering refers to the process of developing the user interface and functionality that runs directly in the web browser of the user. It involves creating dynamic and interactive elements that users can see and interact with on a website or web application. This aspect of web development focuses on enhancing the user experience, improving interactivity, and making the interface visually appealing. They make use of programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and VBScript.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Client-side developers complete a variety of tasks, including:</dt>
                    <dd>Creating website layouts</dd>
                    <dd>Designing user interfaces</dd>
                    <dd>Adding form validation</dd>
                    <dd>Reviewing the performance of websites</dd>
                    <dd>Adding visual design elements like colours and fonts</dd>
                    <dd>Making website features more functional</dd>
                    <dd>Resolving any issues that users encounter on a site</dd>
                </dl>
                <h3>Server-side engineering</h3>
                <p>Server-side engineering, also known as backend development, involves building and maintaining the server-side components of a web application. These components handle data processing, business logic, and database interactions. Server-side engineering is responsible for the behind-the-scenes functionality that supports the user interface and interactions created by client-side engineering. Server-side programming languages are languages like Java, Python, SQL and PHP.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Server-side tasks include:</dt>
                    <dd>Coding dynamic websites</dd>
                    <dd>Developing web applications</dd>
                    <dd>Connecting websites to databases</dd>
                    <dd>Implementing content management systems</dd>
                    <dd>Making sure programs retrieve information properly</dd>

                    <dd>Client-side and server-side engineering are two very important concepts in software and web development. These types of development have many differences, including their purposes and programming languages. Client-side and server-side engineering are both equally as important to make the functionality, user experience and design as good as possible.</dd>
